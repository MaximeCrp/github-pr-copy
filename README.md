# GitHub copy PR

Simplify copying GitHub PRs title and link to send for review in internal communication channels.

## Copy Markdown Title

Minified JS script that copies the current URL and formats it as a markdown link. For the label, the script looks for the `js-issue-title` class that should be the PR title if the window is a PR window.
